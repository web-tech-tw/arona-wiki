Hello!

This is the bridge for LINE and Matrix,

to communicate with the chat room which belongs to both of the different providers.

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/supersonictw/matrix-line-bridge/master/logo.svg)

The bridge is using [line-bot-sdk-nodejs](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-nodejs) and [matrix-bot-sdk](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk) for transporting.

## Refactoring

Since [fd9249](https://github.com/web-tech-tw/matrix-line-bridge/commit/fd9249893a3b2f56ef607fe8f5b0f142d648deaa), `matrix-line-bridge` is converting to TypeScript from Python.

So there is no document temporarily.
